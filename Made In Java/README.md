# Java Documentation

## Starting
testing JavaFX lead nowhere so I have decided to look into using the processing libraries or swing or even OpenGL. as of [3800245](https://github.com/ZackJorquera/Keyword_Object_Detection/commit/3800245ab240b9e7888353c04e54c23583610418#diff-61ba9bd4eb74cadbaf0c341dd9542c98) I have started to make the java application. I'm starting with a plain console app like the c++ version. 
Getting openCV and Mongo was very easy because all I have to do was link up the .jar files.
